# PAJ Automation Hub

This project is the starter workspace for building lightweight automation tools using:
- Firebase (for backend + hosting)
- GitHub (for version control + deployments)
- No-code / low-code extensions later (like Kodular if needed)

## Project Goals
1. Build simple automation flows for up to 10 initial clients.
2. Use free Firebase tier for hosting/backend.
3. Keep the code minimal so it runs cheaply.
4. Expand later after generating revenue.

## Current Status
☑ Repository created  
⬜ Firebase connection  
⬜ Basic backend setup  
⬜ Automation logic  
⬜ Dashboard interface  

## Next Steps
After the repository structure is ready, we will:
- add the dev.nix (optional)
- add Firebase config files
- initialize hosting
- build simple API endpoints
- connect to automation triggers
